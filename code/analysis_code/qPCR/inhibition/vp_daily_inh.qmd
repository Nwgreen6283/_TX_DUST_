# Intro

#### Libs

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

#### Data

```{r}
vp<- read_csv(here("data", "raw_data","vp_daily_inh.csv"))
```

# Cleaning

```{r}
vp<- vp %>%
  mutate(site = substr(Sample, 1,2)) %>% #Make Site column
  filter(!Content %in% "NTC",
         Fluor %in% "HEX") %>% #Take out NTC
  select(site, Cq, Sample) #Select colummns of interest
```

Plot

```{r}
vp %>%
  ggplot() + geom_boxplot(
    aes(x = Sample,
        y = Cq,
        color = site)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 26.86)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title= "Vp Daily Inhibition Check",
    subtitle = "BO = Blind Oso // C2 = Canals // RD = Gulf // E3 = 10^3 +Control")+
  theme(
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("BO" = "#809C52",
                                "C2" = "#ba4716",
                                "RD" = "#4c848c",
                                "E3" = "darkorange"))
```

I think that this is due more to variation in aliquoting than inhibition. Samples all had E3 spiked into mastermix prior to adding it to strip tubes. The E3 for the +C (denoted here as E3) had the mastermix placed into the strip tube, and then 3.96ÂµL of spike added.
