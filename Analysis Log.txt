WARNING: 3 data points excluded without a valid starting quantity (SQ)!
Here is a sample of the data being excluded:

"Well"	"Fluor"	"Target"	"Content"	"Sample"	"Cq"	"SQ"	"Copy.Estimate"	"Mod"
"P22"	"SYBR"	NA	"NTC"	NA	NA	NA	NA	0
"P23"	"SYBR"	NA	"NTC"	NA	NA	NA	NA	0
"P24"	"SYBR"	NA	"NTC"	NA	NA	NA	NA	0


These standards not included in NA standard curve regression for copy estimate calculations, because they detected below 50%: 


Data Summary:
"Standards"	"Target"	"Reps"	"Detects"	"Cq.mean"	"Cq.sd"	"Copy.CV"	"Cq.CV"	"Rate"
NA	NA	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA


For NA, the lowest standard with 95% or greater detection is: NA copies/reaction.

WARNING: LoD cannot be determined for NA, because it is lower than the lowest standard you tested.
Report as <NA copies/reaction, or retest with lower concentrations.


Assay summary:

R.squared: The R-squared value of linear regression of all standards Cq-values vs log10 of the starting quantities.
Slope: The slope of the linear regression.
Intercept: The y-intercept of the linear regression.

Low.95: The lowest standard with at least 95% positive detection.
LOD: The 95% limit of detection as determined by probit modeling.
LOQ: The limit of quantification as determined by decay modeling, using the user-selected CV threshold of: 0.35

rep2.LOD: The effective limit of detection if analyzing in 2 replicates.
rep3.LOD: The effective limit of detection if analyzing in 3 replicates.
rep4.LOD: The effective limit of detection if analyzing in 4 replicates.
rep5.LOD: The effective limit of detection if analyzing in 5 replicates.
rep8.LOD: The effective limit of detection if analyzing in 8 replicates.
